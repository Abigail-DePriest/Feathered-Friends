## Project Overview

Feathered Friends is a frontend birdwatching racker app built in React. It allows users to maintain a visual bird-sighting library, add new sightings, and keep a wishlist of birds they hope to find.

This project was inspired by personal birdwatching experiences and the desire to recognize patterns in bird habitats—such as time of year, flora, and environmental features—through consistent tracking.
